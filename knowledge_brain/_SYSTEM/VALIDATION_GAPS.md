## Validation Gap Patterns

| Pattern | Occurrences | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Client-side-only validation (no server guard) | 5+ (Estimation, BT, Tagging, Customer Order) | Trust in JS POST data |
| SQL injection via raw variable concat | **25+** (Masters, Chit Reports, Account, Catalog, Customer, Payment, **Sales Transfer 17**, BT 6, Employee, OI) | Legacy `$this->db->query()` with string concat |
| Missing foreign key / existence check | 6+ (Estimation items, BT bill details, OMP tags, BT tag items, SI, LOT) | Implicit FK reliance |
| OTP implementation bugs | 2 (Account, Payment) | Copy-paste error (`=` vs `==`) |
| No row-level locking on shared resources | 5+ (Tag status, Gift voucher, Scheme account, Receipt no, Issue no, Process no) | Missing `FOR UPDATE` / `LOCK TABLES` |
| Silent failure (function runs but persists nothing) | 3 (Customer agent alloc, employee alloc, image upload) | Variable overwrite bug, missing DB call |
| Path traversal / LFI | 1 (Customer KYC download) | No input sanitization on file paths |
| Hard delete without child cleanup | 4 (Payment, Customer, Employee, Scheme) | Missing cascade or explicit child cleanup |
| Type coercion bugs | 2 (CusOrd AP-11, Payment OTP) | PHP loose comparison on array/int |
| CSRF via GET | 2 (LOT delete, Scheme delete) | DELETE operation accessible via GET request |
| Decimal precision mismatch | 1 (Sales Transfer — `decimal(10,0)` vs `decimal(10,2)`) | Header truncates detail precision |
| base64 password storage | 2 (Customer, Employee) | Trivially reversible — not hashed |
| `trans_commit()` in error branch | 1 (Estimation) | Partial saves permanently persisted |
| Stock decrement not reversed on delete | 2 (LOT delete, BT cancel) | No reversal logic exists |
| OTP value leaked in API response | 2 (Stock Issue, Section Transfer) | OTP returned in JSON response |
| XSS via unescaped DOM injection | 1 (Stock Issue OTP modal) | `.append()` with server msg |
| No server-side formula validation | 2 (Tagging sales_value, Estimation) | JS-computed values trusted |
| Functions defined twice in JS | 2 (Tagging wastage/MC, tax calc) | Second definition overwrites first |
| Undefined variable in production | 2 (Sales Transfer `$insId`, `$tb_entry_date`) | PHP warning, silent failure |
| Missing `trans_begin()` entirely | 3 (Sales Transfer download methods) | Writes without any transaction |
| OTP `=` (assignment) instead of `==` | 2 (Account gift OTP, Payment OTP) | OTP always passes |
| LOCK TABLES commented / no row locking | 6+ (Tag, Voucher, Scheme, Receipt, Issue, AccountNo) | Race condition duplicates |
| `clear_database()` no auth gate | 1 (Masters) | Any user can wipe DB |
| `echo last_query();exit;` kills rollback | 4+ (Purchase L322/L452/L631, LOT merge) | Debug code prevents transaction rollback |
| DELETE-INSERT pattern on edit | 2+ (Catalog purities, Customer Order stones) | Data loss if re-insert fails |
| LIKE injection via unescaped search | 2 (Catalog products, sub-products) | Wildcard injection |
| SQL injection via model raw concat | **36+** (Masters 11+, Catalog 11+, Employee 6+, ST 17, others) | All legacy query patterns |
| NB payment uses cash_amount field | 1 (Old Metal Process OMP-003) | Wrong payment source field |
| Commented-out status update code | 1 (Old Metal melting_status L744-755) | Business logic silently disabled |
| Variable undefined in production | 5+ (ST `$insId`, OMP `$id_branch`, Scheme `$id`, Dashboard `$id_category`) | NULL values or wrong behavior |
| Copy-paste identical SQL for different purposes | 1 (Dashboard old vs new customer) | Both queries return same data |
| JS-only validation, no server guard | 2+ (OMP pocket weight, Tagging sales_value) | POST manipulation bypasses |
| 0% variant test coverage | 2 (Catalog 324 combos, Sales Transfer 15 combos) | No testing of config-dependent behavior |
| Hardcoded OTP for production | 1 (Chit Collection 123456) | Authentication bypass |
| CORS wildcard (*) on API | 1 (Chit Collection REST) | Cross-origin attack surface |
| No API auth / IDOR | 2 (Chit Collection, Chit Customer) | Unauthenticated data access |
| Wallet debit before gateway confirm | 1 (Chit Customer App) | Money loss on failure |
| Log dir web-exposed with PII | 1 (Chit Reports 31 files) | Data breach via URL |
| Address INSERT instead of UPDATE | 1 (Employee) | N duplicates per employee |
| `trans_status()` without `trans_begin()` | 1 (Employee add) | False atomicity |
| `configDB()` calls commented out | 1 (Chit Settings) | Config changes never saved |
| `get_access()` returns NULL | 1 (Masters) | Auth chain breaks |
