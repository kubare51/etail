## Active Cross-Module Bugs

| Bug ID | Modules Affected | Description | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| XMOD-001 | Chit Reports → Payment | `cancel_payment` has no transaction wrapping — step 3 (cancel) can succeed, step 4 (log) can fail | 🔴 P0 | Open |
| XMOD-002 | Account / Payment | SMS gateway if/elseif chain duplicated 8+ times — changing one doesn't update others | 🟡 P2 | Open |
| XMOD-003 | Account / Payment | OTP returned in JSON response body (5 endpoints) — client-side readable | 🔴 P0 | Open |
| XMOD-004 | Account (L4188) / Payment (L5081) | OTP comparison uses `=` (assignment) instead of `==` — always evaluates true | 🔴 P0 | Open |
| XMOD-005 | System | `admin/log/` directory has 31 PII log files web-accessible — no `.htaccess` protection | 🔴 P0 | Open |
| XMOD-006 | Billing → Estimation | Bill save updates `ret_estimation.estbillid` — if save fails mid-transaction, estimation partially linked to nonexistent bill | 🔴 P1 | Open |
| XMOD-007 | Chit Reports | SQL injection in `get_customerenquiry_by_date` — raw `$status`/`$type` concat | 🔴 P0 | Open |
| XMOD-008 | Tagging / Billing / BT / Section Transfer / Stock Issue / Sales Transfer / Old Metal / Customer Order | `tag_status` written by 8 modules with no centralized state machine — race conditions possible | 🟡 P2 | Open — by design |
| XMOD-009 | Billing → Tagging | `get_tag_status()` check is not atomic with status update — two concurrent bills can reference same tag | 🔴 P1 | Open |
| XMOD-010 | Customer Order → Tagging | Repair save (type=4) sets `id_orderdetails` but NOT `tag_status=8`; update sets both — inconsistent | 🟡 P2 | Open |
| XMOD-011 | Old Metal → ret_taging | `tag_process=1` set at pocket creation but no rollback if pocket is cancelled/deleted | 🟡 P2 | Open |
| XMOD-012 | Masters → System | `clear_database()` reachable without OTP verification | 🔴 P0 | Open |

## Resolved Cross-Module Bugs

| Bug ID | Modules Affected | Root Cause | Fix | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RPT-INT01 | Reports (categorywise vs categorywise_stone) | Missing query in variant function | Added Branch Transfer Out status log query | 2026-03-04 |

## Cross-Module Patterns

| Pattern | Frequency | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| No transaction wrapping on multi-step cross-module writes | 4+ occurrences | Wrap all cross-table writes in `trans_begin`/`trans_complete` |
| Multiple modules writing same status field | 8 modules write `tag_status` | Centralized state machine or at minimum, status validation before write |
| OTP bypass via assignment vs comparison | 2 occurrences | Code review checklist item + static analysis |
| SQL injection via raw parameter concat | 8+ occurrences | Use parameterized queries exclusively |
| SMS gateway duplication | 8+ copies | Extract to single shared method |
| Rate fetched at page load, not at save time | 3+ modules | Server-side rate lock at transaction time |
| PCI/security sensitive data storage | 3 columns (CVV, card_no, exp_date) + base64 passwords | Remove CVV column, tokenize card data, hash passwords |
| Hard delete without child cascade | 2+ (Customer→KYC, Payment→mode_details) | Add explicit child cleanup before parent delete |
| Type coercion causing always-true conditions | 3+ (OTP `=` vs `==`, array-to-int compare) | Strict type checking, `===` comparisons |
