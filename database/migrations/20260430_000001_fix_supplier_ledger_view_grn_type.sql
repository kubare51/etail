-- Migration: Fix supplier ledger view to exclude smith/job work entries (grn_type 2 & 4)
-- Date: 30-04-2026
-- Issue: Smith ledger entries (grn_type = 4, PJ-*) were appearing in supplier ledger
--        and inflating the supplier outstanding amount
-- Fix: Changed `grn.grn_type <> 2` to `grn.grn_type NOT IN (2,4)` in 3 UNION ALL sections
--       (Purchase Order Items, TDS, TCS)
-- Impact: Removes grn_type 2 (Smith Receipt) & 4 (Purchase Job Work) from supplier outstanding

-- To apply, run the full CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement below:
